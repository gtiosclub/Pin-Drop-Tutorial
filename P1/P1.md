## Part 1: Create new project

This tutorial will teach you how to build an app where you can drop, and save, pins on a map!

The first thing that you will do is create the project within Xcode. So, open up Xcode, and you should be able to see this screen:

Click on "Create a new Xcode project", then a default screen should appear:

<p align="center"> <img src="/images/createProject.png" align="center"> </p>

Make sure "Single View Application" is selected and click "Next." On the next screen, make your project's name "Pin Drop":

We will be using Core Data to implement persistence in our app, so make sure "Use Core Data" is selected. Click "Next", and then save the project anywhere you want to on your computer.

Now you have successfully created your new project on Xcode! In the next part, we will actually be creating the interface for our Pin Drop app.
