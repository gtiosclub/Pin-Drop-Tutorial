## Part 2: Set up screen layout for Pin Drop app

**Interface builder** is Xcode's GUI editor. For most projects, the interface is contained in the `Main.storyboard` file. Open it up and have a look around:

<p align="center"> <img src="/images/storyboardPic.png" align="center"> </p>

You should see something that looks like this. There are three important parts worth knowing:

1. **Editor Canvas:** This is where you design your layouts. What you see here is what you will get when you run the app on your phone, to an extent.
3. **The Inspector:** This pane is where you modify anything and everything. It shows options for whatever you have selected.
4. **UI Palette:** Nestled at the bottom of the inspector, the UI Palette is where you find the components that you use to build your interfaces.

That big white square in the middle is your first View Controller. Any changes you make to this view will appear on your screen when you run the app.

Now, for our Pin Drop app, we will simply be using a map where you'll be able to drop some pins.

Let's start building the screen!

### Navigation Controller

We will first embed out View Controller in a `Navigation Controller`. To do this, select the View Controller and, in the top menu bar, select Editor -> Embed In -> Navigation Controller:

Your storyboard should now look similar to this:

<p align="center"> <img src="/images/navStoryboard.png" align="center"> </p>

### Map Kit View

In order to display pins on the map, we are going to work with the Interface builder and the UI Palette. Go ahead to the UI Palette and scroll until you find `Map Kit View`:

<p align="center"> <img src="/images/mapKitView.png" align="center"> </p>

Select `Map Kit View`, and drag and drop it in your view controller:

<p align="center"> <img src="/images/dragMap.png" align="center"> </p>

Resize your map and add some constraints so that it occupies the whole screen:

<p align="center"> <img src="/images/mapConstraints.png" align="center"> </p>

Awesome! Now we have our view! If you run the application on the simulator, however, you will see that the app won't run, and you get an error that says "uncaught exception 'NSInvalidUnarchiveOperationException', reason: 'Could not instantiate class named MKMapView'". This is because, although we already have our `MKMapView` on the storyboard, we still need to add the `MapKit` framework to our project.

To do this, select your project in the project navigator (top left corner), select the Pin Drop target, and press the "+" button in "Linked Frameworks and Libraries."

<p align="center"> <img src="/images/addMapKitFramework.png" align="center"> </p>

Search for `MapKit`, select it, and press "add".

<p align="center"> <img src="/images/addMapKit.png" align="center"> </p>

If you run the app on the simulator, you should now be able to see the map.

### IBOutlet

For the final step in this section, we will be creating an `IBOutlet` that connects our map to Swift code. The ViewController displayed in the storyboard is automatically connected to a file called `ViewController.swift`. Before you open the file up, first click on the view you have in front of you. Now, at the top right corner of the Xcode interface, there is a toolbar. Go ahead and click on what looks like two circles intertwining. This allows you to see both the view from the storyboard and the swift file connected to that view simultaneously:

<p align="center"> <img src="/images/twoScreen.png" align="center"> </p>

Let's link the map in our ViewController to the actual Swift code. In order to do this, click on the map, control-click on it, and drag the blue line that appears to the swift file. Then, once you release the blue line, a little screen will pop up as such:

<p align="center"> <img src="/images/mapOutlet.png" align="center"> </p>

With this screen, you can specify what type of connection you'll make between the label and the code. The type of connection we will need for the map is an `IBOutlet`. Go ahead and name the connection `mapView`, and then click on `Connect`. The end result should look like this:

<p align="center"> <img src="/images/outletCode.png" align="center"> </p>

If you get an error, make sure you import `MapKit` at the top of your Swift file.

### Next Time

Awesome! Now we have our added a connection for our map to Swift code! In the next part, we will be adding some functionality for dropping pins on the map.
